Features:
* Infinite terrain gen, X, Y, and Z
* Grass and flowers on ground
* Expansive caves

NOTE: this project runs REALLY slowly when loading chunks because I haven't implemented threading yet (despite multiple attempts). 

I'm just shipping this project as-is, because after not working on it for over 2 months, I realized that I got all I really wanted out of this project. I've remade Minecraft about 4 times, so getting to this point was good enough for me. I just wanted to learn C++ and Raylib, and this project did a pretty good job teaching me.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS: Make sure that CMake and some C++ compiler is installed. Navigate to root of project and run "cmake ." and then "cmake --build ." (the CMakeLists.txt should automatically handle dependencies).
